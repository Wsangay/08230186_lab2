    <h2>My Aspirations</h2>
    <p class="aspiration-text">
     My aspiration as an ICT teacher is to inspire students to see technology as more than just a subject, but as a tool for creativity, problem-solving, and lifelong learning. I strive to create an engaging learning environment where students gain not only technical skills but also the confidence to use ICT responsibly and effectively in real-life situations. By staying updated with emerging technologies and innovative teaching methods, I aim to guide my students in becoming adaptable, ethical, and future-ready digital citizens.
